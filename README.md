AI Product Manager in the making — I connect strategy, users, and engineering to ship AI-powered products that drive measurable business outcomes. I'm an MBA candidate at Bayes Business School (London) with 6+ years in software engineering and integrations, now focused on building and scaling AI features, workflows, and go‑to‑market motions.

- Research → roadmap: Synthesized insights from 25+ stakeholder interviews to design scalable AI-driven workflows; aligned engineering, product, and GTM around actionable roadmaps.
- Segment and positioning strategy: Built frameworks to identify untapped segments and tailor offerings and sales plays (MishiPay) — supporting a path to £10M ARR via UK expansion.
- Systems thinking from code up: Migrated legacy (Struts) to microservices and RESTful APIs; introduced schedulers for resilient deployments — improving operational efficiency by 40%+.
- Integration at scale: Built/tested 100+ APIs; integrated 20+ marketplaces and 8+ payment gateways; instituted version control and code reviews; mentored engineers.
